copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n\
(an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n\
\n\
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n\
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n\
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n\
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n\

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n\
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n\
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n\

institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n\
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n\

attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n\
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n\
the Derivative Works; and\n\
\n\
(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n\
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n\
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n\
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n\
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n\
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n\
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n\
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n\
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n\
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n\
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n\
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n\
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n\
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n\
as modifying the License.\n\

may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n\
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n\
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n\
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n\
the conditions stated in this License.\n\

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n\
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n\
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n\

origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\
\n\
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n\
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n\
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n\
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n\
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n\
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n\
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n\
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n\
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\
\n\
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n\
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n\
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n\
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n\
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n\
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n\
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n\
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n\
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n\
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\
\n\
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n\
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n\
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n\
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n\
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n\
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n\
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n\
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n\
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n\
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\
\n\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n\
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n\
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n\
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n\
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n\
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\n\
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\n\
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\n\
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n\
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n\
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n\
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n\
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\n\
\n\
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n\
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n\
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\
\n\
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n\
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n\
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\n\
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\
\n\
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n\
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n\
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n\
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n\
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n\
      meet the following conditions:\n\
\n\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\
\n\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n\
          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
\n\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n\
          the Derivative Works; and\n\
\n\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n\
          as modifying the License.\n\
\n\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n\
      the conditions stated in this License.\n\
\n\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\
\n\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\
\n\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\
\n\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\
\n\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\

\n\
    Common Public License - v 1.0\n\
\n\
    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON\n\
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\n\
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\
\n\
    1. DEFINITIONS\n\
\n\
    "Contribution" means:\n\
\n\
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n\
       documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\
\n\
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\
\n\
       i)  changes to the Program, and\n\
\n\
       ii) additions to the Program;\n\
\n\
       where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n\
       and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n\
       'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n\
       such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\n\
       Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are\n\
       separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the\n\
       Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative\n\
       works of the Program.\n\
\n\
    "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\
\n\
    "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\n\
    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\n\
    or when combined with the Program.\n\
\n\
    "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n\
    Agreement.\n\
\n\
    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n\
    including all Contributors.\n\
\n\
    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\
\n\
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n\
       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license\n\
       to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n\
       perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n\
       Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\n\
       object code form.\n\
\n\
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n\
       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n\
       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and\n\
       otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in\n\
       source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to\n\
       the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time\n\
       the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the\n\
       Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed\n\
       Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\n\
       which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed\n\
       hereunder.\n\
\n\
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n\
       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n\
       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n\
       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n\
       Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n\
       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n\
       property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights\n\
       and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n\
       responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\n\
       needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is\n\
       required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is\n\
       Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before\n\
       distributing the Program.\n\
\n\
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n\
       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n\
       license set forth in this Agreement.\n\
\n\
    3. REQUIREMENTS\n\
\n\
    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\n\
    under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\
\n\
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) its license agreement:\n\
\n\
       i)   effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n\
            and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n\
            conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties\n\
            or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular\n\
            purpose;\n\
\n\
       ii)  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\n\
            for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n\
            consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\
\n\
       iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n\
            offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\
\n\
       iv)  states that source code for the Program is available from such\n\
            Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n\
            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n\
            software exchange.\n\
\n\
    When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\
\n\
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n\
       the Program.\n\
\n\
    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n\
    within the Program.\n\
\n\
    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\n\
    Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\n\
    Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\
\n\
    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\
\n\
    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n\
    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n\
    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n\
    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\n\
    should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\n\
    other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program\n\
    in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial\n\
    Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other\n\
    Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages\n\
    and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and\n\
    other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n\
    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\n\
    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\n\
    Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this\n\
    section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual\n\
    or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify,\n\
    an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\n\
    Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial\n\
    Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor\n\
    in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified\n\
    Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\
\n\
    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n\
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n\
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n\
    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n\
    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n\
    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n\
    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those\n\
    performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\n\
    Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\n\
    must pay those damages.\n\
\n\
    5. NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED\n\
    ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n\
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\n\
    CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR\n\
    A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for\n\
    determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program\n\
    and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this\n\
    Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program\n\
    errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\n\
    programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\
\n\
    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\
\n\
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\n\
    ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n\
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\n\
    WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\n\
    LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\n\
    NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\n\
    DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\n\
    HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
    7. GENERAL\n\
\n\
    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n\
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n\
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\n\
    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n\
    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\
\n\
    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\n\
    respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or\n\
    counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\n\
    Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of\n\
    the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes\n\
    patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or\n\
    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding\n\
    combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes\n\
    such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n\
    Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\n\
    to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\n\
    and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\n\
    becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under\n\
    this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\n\
    of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's\n\
    obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\n\
    relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\
\n\
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n\
    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\n\
    only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\n\
    the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\n\
    from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right\n\
    to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may\n\
    assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable\n\

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\
\n\
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n\
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n\
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\
\n\
\n\
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates\n\
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\n\
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n\
\n\
  0. Additional Definitions.\n\
\n\
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\n\
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU\n\
General Public License.\n\
\n\
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\n\
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\
\n\
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\n\
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\n\
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\n\
of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\
\n\
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an\n\
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\n\
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked\n\
Version".\n\
\n\
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the\n\
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\n\
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\n\
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\
\n\
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the\n\
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\n\
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\n\
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\
\n\
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\
\n\
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\n\
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\
\n\
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\
\n\
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\n\
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\n\
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\n\
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\n\
version:\n\
\n\
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n\
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n\
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n\
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\
\n\
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n\
   this License applicable to that copy.\n\
\n\
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\
\n\
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\n\
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\n\
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\n\
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\n\
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n\
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\
\n\
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n\
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n\
   covered by this License.\n\
\n\
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n\
   document.\n\
\n\
  4. Combined Works.\n\
\n\
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\n\
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\n\
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\n\
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\n\
the following:\n\
\n\
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n\
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n\
   covered by this License.\n\
\n\
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n\
   document.\n\
\n\
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n\
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n\
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n\
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\
\n\
   d) Do one of the following:\n\
\n\
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n\
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n\
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n\
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n\
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n\
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n\
       Corresponding Source.\n\
\n\
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n\
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n\
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n\
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n\
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n\
       Version.\n\
\n\
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n\
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n\
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n\
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n\
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n\
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n\
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n\
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n\
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n\
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n\
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\
\n\
  5. Combined Libraries.\n\
\n\
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n\
Library side by side in a single library together with other library\n\
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\n\
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\n\
choice, if you do both of the following:\n\
\n\
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n\
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n\
   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\
\n\
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n\
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n\
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\
\n\
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\
\n\
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n\
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\n\
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n\
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
\n\
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n\
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\n\
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"\n\
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n\
conditions either of that published version or of any later version\n\
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\n\
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\n\
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\n\
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
\n\
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\n\
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\n\
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\n\
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\n\
Library.\n\
